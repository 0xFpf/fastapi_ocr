# FastAPI_OCR

This is an implementation of some elements from my OCR & NLP Search Engine project.

Its goal is to be able to extract text from images in bulk.

This does not make use of any third party api's or fastapi extension libraries such as Fastapi-Users.

At the time the idea was conceived there were no websites that allowed in-bulk OCR solutions.

Here's a Demo as of 27/12/23:
